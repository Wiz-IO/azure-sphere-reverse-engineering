# Reverse engineering of Azure Sphere

It sounds weird, doesn't it?

This project is an attempt to **UNIX-LIKE** ( Linux, Mac and Windows ) support platforms for Azure Sphere boards...

## What needs
* Any IDE as VS Code or Atom ( I use [PlatformIO](https://github.com/Wiz-IO/platform-azure) )
* GCC linux-hard-float ... [example](https://releases.linaro.org/components/toolchain/binaries/7.2-2017.11/)
* [Application Image Packer](https://github.com/Wiz-IO/azure-sphere-reverse-engineering/tree/master/packer)
* [Uploader](https://github.com/Wiz-IO/azure-sphere-reverse-engineering/tree/master/uploader)


## PACKER

The image is **asxipfs** file system ( customization of the **cramfs** ) plus Microsoft meta-data footer

Ð¢here are several "problems" to solve, marked in the code with ???????

## UPLOADER

The protocol is a simple REST-API client over HTTPS ... https://192.168.35.1/2

As first test - [It is worked](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Wiz-IO/LIB/master/images/pyAzsphere.jpg) 

UART Slip to Tun/Tap interface
* BaudRate = 921600
* Parity = None
* DataBits = 8
* StopBits = One
* Handshake = RequestToSend

**REST-API Commands**

GET, POST, PUT, DELETE ...

azsphere device show-attached
* GET http://192.168.35.2/device/security_state
* Response {"securityState":"SECURE","generalPublicKey":"22...67","deviceIdentityPublicKey":"E1...3E"}

Get Status
* GET https://192.168.35.2/status
* Response {"uptime":288}
