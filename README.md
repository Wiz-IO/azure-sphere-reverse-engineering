# Reverse engineering of Azure Sphere

It sounds weird, doesn't it?

This project is an attempt to UNIX-LIKE ( Linux, Mac and Windows ) support platforms for Azure Sphere boards...

What we need:
* Any IDE as VS Code or Atom ( I use [PlatformIO](https://github.com/Wiz-IO/platform-azure) )
* GCC unix hard float
* [Application Image Packer](https://github.com/Wiz-IO/azure-sphere-reverse-engineering/tree/master/packer)
* [Uploader](https://github.com/Wiz-IO/azure-sphere-reverse-engineering/tree/master/uploader)
